# [FRC-2026] REBUILT

In [REBUILT™ presented by Haas](https://info.firstinspires.org/first-age), During the 2025-2026 FIRST season, FIRST® Robotics Competition 
teams will use engineering skills and re-imagine the past.

Every artifact we uncover holds a story. Each tool, each innovation, each work of art connects us to the people and 
ideas that came before us. Using STEM skills and teamwork, today we can dig deeper into discoveries than ever before.

## Reminders

- [ ] Fetch your current branch before start to work
- [ ] Create a branch to work on your changes
- [ ] Push your changes to the remote at the end of the day so you can access it from any machine
- [ ] Create a PR to merge back to main branch

## Contributions

The repositories are public, and you should be able to clone them without extra permissions.

If you want to push code directly, you need to ask for writing permissions.

- [ ] Get writing permissions (optional)
    - [ ] Join the Aztechs programming team
        - [ ] Create a Github account
        - [ ] Go to the `#programming` channel in the Aztechs Slack and ask permissions to the Github repositories
